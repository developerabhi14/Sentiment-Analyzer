Sentiment Classification of IMDB Movie Reviews

This project is a text classification app that uses TF-IDF vectorization and Scikit-learn models to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative. The focus is on building a clean preprocessing pipeline and leveraging traditional machine learning to deliver reliable sentiment predictions.

The initial corpus had over 214,000 unique tokens. By limiting the feature space to the most informative 5,000 tokens using max_features=5000, we were able to significantly reduce noise and improve the model‚Äôs performance by approximately 1% in accuracy.
